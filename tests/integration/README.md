# Integration Tests

This directory is for integration tests that test the CLI and API functionality of BUSCOlite.

## Future Tests

The following integration tests should be added in the future:

1. `test_buscolite_cli.py` - Tests for the command-line interface
2. `test_buscolite_api.py` - Tests for the Python API

These tests are referenced in the GitHub Actions workflow but are not yet implemented.
